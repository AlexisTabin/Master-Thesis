\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:outlook}
In our exploration, each step of the pipeline~(cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:pipeline}) reveals opportunities for refinement and expansion:
\begin{enumerate}

 \item \textit{Data:} Our experiment was conducted using physical activity data from 2003 to 2006. However, there is potential to improve our dataset by including data available until 2014. Moreover, we could enrich our analysis by incorporating diverse digital biomarkers such as heart rate and tension into our analysis, using multivariate time series instead of univariate. By doing so, we can enhance the predictive power of our model.
% We also acknowledge the paramount importance of data ethics, privacy, and usage in mobile health. It is crucial to gain patients' trust in the data collection process for pervasive collection of digital biomarkers. Therefore, we need to adopt transparent communication and ethical practices to ensure patient privacy and data ethics.
 % \item \textit{\gls{tser}:} Our study highlights the importance of conducting more research in the \gls{tser} field to enhance model accuracy. We have identified a gap in the task of estimating biological age from physical activity, where the best model achieved an \gls{mae} of 12 years. To improve model performance and obtain more precise estimations, we suggest exploring alternative methodologies or incorporating novel features.
 \item \textit{\gls{tsxair}}: Based on recent research by Letzgus et al. \cite{letzgus_toward_2022} and Shim et al. \cite{shim_wearable-based_2023}, we can improve our explainable framework by using Contextualised \gls{xai} techniques and population clusters based on physical activity patterns. We aim to enhance our approach by exploring alternative mutation techniques suggested in the \gls{tsevo} paper and using \gls{llm}s or text-based models for automated recommendations. These improvements will empower our approach and make it more effective.
 \item \textit{Recommendations:} Analyzing the extensive archive of TSER datasets compiled by Guijo et al. \cite{guijo-rubio_unsupervised_2023} provides an opportunity to gain insights and potentially incorporate expert recommendations into our recommender system. Additionally, it is essential to test our method with diverse datasets, particularly those with well-established outcomes, to ensure that our counterfactual explanations align with common medical understanding. This validation step is crucial in enhancing the credibility and applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios.
\end{enumerate}
Considering these suggestions, we aim to refine our methodology and advance the field of mobile health by fostering trust, improving accuracy, and enhancing the interpretability of our model's recommendations.
